# Volcano Hotend mount

A hotend mount for a volcano chc and v6 heatsink with the pheatus dragon hole pattern. Based off of bythorsthunders rapido UHF https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/bythorsthunder/Stealthburner_Rapido_Uhf and the official dragon hotend mount. 

### Why I made it

I needed an abrasives hotend and did not want to use my rapido uhf as the heatbreak could wear out. I also did not want to have two different steathburner covers and x cariages etc. I decided to build a hotend using a titanium heatbreak, a v6 heatsink with a dragon hole pattern, a chc heater with a PT1000, and a bondtech bi metal 0.6mm cht which I already had on hand.

### Compatibility

This is a direct drop in replacement for the rapido uhf hotend mount. It puts the nozzle right where the rapido nozzle would be and uses the same cooling ducts. It should work with a regular volcano heater block but I have not tested this. If anybody wants to try it please let me know the results!

## Enjoy!
